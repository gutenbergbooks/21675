<h1><i>THE OLDEN-TIME SERIES.</i></h1>

<p class="center">16mo. Per vol., 50 cents.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for quaint
and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this, Mr. Henry
M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The materials
have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and Salem, sources
not easily accessible, and while not professing to be history, the volumes
contain much material for history, so combined and presented as to be both
amusing and instructive. The titles of some of the volumes indicate their
scope and their promise of entertainment:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1em;">
<span class="smcap">Curiosities of the Old Lottery.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Days of the Spinning-Wheel.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Some Strange and Curious Punishments.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Quaint and Curious Advertisements.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Literary Curiosities.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">New-England Sunday, etc.</span><br />
</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>"It has been the good fortune of the writer to be allowed a peep at the
manuscript for this series, and he can assure the lovers of the historical
and the quaint in literature that something both valuable and pleasant is
in store for them. In the specialties treated of in these books Mr. Brooks
has been for many years a careful collector and student, and it is
gratifying to learn that the material is to be committed to book
form."&mdash;<i>Salem Gazette.</i></p>

<h2><a name="ADVERTISEMENTS" id="ADVERTISEMENTS"></a><i>ADVERTISEMENTS.</i></h2>

<p><i>Advertisements are sometimes very amusing. They give insights into the
manners of the times no less interesting than authentic. Suppose the
ancients had possessed a press, and that a volume of a Roman</i> Post <i>or</i>
Chronicle <i>had been dug up at Herculaneum, with what curiosity should we
not contemplate the millinery of the Roman ladies, or, "Wanted, a
Gladiator to fight the last new lion;" or, "Next Ides of November will be
published the new poem of Quintus Horatius Flaccus"!</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leigh Hunt</span>.</p>

<h2>QUAINT</h2>

<p class="center">AND</p>

<h2>CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the mass of advertisements that have appeared from time to time in
newspapers are to be found some which are very quaint and curious. Such
are not, in all cases, intended by the writers to be so; but they sound
so, especially to those persons who have an ear for strange or humorous
things. Sometimes, indeed, it is the intention of the writers to attract
particular notice by the wording of the advertisement. Oftentimes the
matter may have been dictated by illiterate persons. Frequently the nature
of the subject is itself sufficient to excite our humorous feelings. But
whatever may be the object of the advertiser,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> these productions are often
amusing and interesting enough to be reproduced for the benefit of those
who cannot conveniently read the originals.</p>

<p>In the year 1759 competition in trade had not reached the proportions that
it has since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> assumed, for the "ill-natured opposition" which two women
met with according to the "Boston Gazette" of August 13, that year, was
probably nothing more or less than the treatment of some competitor in the
same line,&mdash;perhaps a man mean enough to undersell. Such things have
frequently occurred in our day,&mdash;some mammoth establishment cutting prices
purposely, to drive some poor woman out of business whose sole dependence
is in a small shop selling cotton, pins, needles, etc., barely making a
living at it. "Rule or ruin" is the motto of too many in these days; and
such men are called "smart," and if they get rich are fairly worshipped
for their enterprise.</p>

<p>In 1760 the town clerk of Boston issued a notice to the public in
reference to persons forestalling the market by falsely representing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
farmers and others that the small-pox was prevalent in the town, which had
so frightened the market-men that they were glad to sell outside the town
and at lower prices than they otherwise would have done.</p>

<p>The town of Beverly has always been noted for beans, and it will be seen
that as early as 1771 Josiah Woodbury offered two bushels as a reward to
any person who would keep his "House Plague," who had run away from him.
The question naturally arises, Was "Old Moll" Mr. Woodbury's wife?</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>On the departure of Governor Hutchinson from the Province of Massachusetts
in 1774,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> a hundred and twenty-three citizens of Boston, together with
sundry citizens of Salem, Marblehead, and other places, signed a
complimentary address to him, "lamenting the loss of so good a Governor,"
and praising him for his character and conduct. Most of these persons
belonged to the better classes; but their action was judged to be, to say
the least, hasty. Shortly after this, these "addressors" were "hauled over
the coals" by the patriots and forced to retract. The following cards from
some of these gentlemen we take from the "Essex Gazette," a newspaper
circulating in Salem and Cambridge. From the known character and standing
of many of these persons, it is believed that they were glad of an
opportunity of thus expressing their patriotism. The first blood of the
Revolution had not been shed when they signed this address to the
Governor, who they had hoped would be able to influence the British
ministry so that war could be averted. But after the battles of Lexington
and Concord there was no longer any hope of a reconciliation, and the
"Committee of Safety," naturally wishing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> be sure as to who were
friends and who were enemies, took this method of ascertaining the fact

claim, I repaired to his hou&#383;e la&#383;t Thur&#383;day to &#383;ettle
with him, and paid him in full the amount of his bill,
&#383;ubtraction made of his three charges: Perceiving his
intention was to make me pay them again, I pocketed the bill;
his pugili&#383;tick arguments to get it back again made me
ob&#383;tinately refu&#383;e it; and thanks to a gentleman then
pre&#383;ent, I e&#383;caped his dirty hands. Unwilling to enter the
field of Themis with &#383;uch an antagoni&#383;t, I will place his
receipted account into any impartial man's hands, and &#383;ubmit
cheerfully to his deci&#383;ion.</p>

<p>To show how factories were supplied with operatives in the early days of
manufacturing in New England, we copy an advertisement from the "Columbian
Centinel," March 4, 1795. This is addressed especially to those parents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
"who can ill afford to maintain their children." How much better off our
manufacturing towns would be if such a system were practicable now!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i><big>An exceeding good opportunity for</big></i></p><p><i>parents</i> (in the&#383;e very
expen&#383;ive times for every nece&#383;&#383;ary of life) <i>to provide
their children with good and comfortable maintenance,
cloathing, &#383;chooling, and a trade, but little known and
under&#383;tood in this country.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Erving</span> propo&#383;es to receive as Apprentices to the Cotton
&amp; Woolen Manufactory (now going on at New-Haven) any number of
Boys or Girls, from the age of ten to fourteen. They will be
in&#383;tructed in all the various branches of the factory, well
cloathed and fed, and taught to read, write and cypher; and
parents may be a&#383;&#383;ured that the mo&#383;t particular attention
will be paid to the morals, as well as to the education, of
their children.</p>

<p>Tho&#383;e who can but ill afford to maintain their children,
have now an opportunity of binding them to a trade which
mu&#383;t, in a few years, be peculiarly beneficial to them and
advantageous to their country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Erving</span> will thank tho&#383;e that have an inclination to put
their children out, to call on him, at his hou&#383;e, No. 42
Marlborough-&#383;treet, Bo&#383;ton, where they can be more
particularly informed of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> nature of the factory, and the
advantages which mu&#383;t eventually accrue to their children
from a general knowledge of this u&#383;eful branch of
bu&#383;ine&#383;s.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><b>Salem,</b></p>

<p>Ye&#383;terday the FRIGATE ESSEX, of 32 guns, was launched from
the &#383;tocks, in this town. She went into the water with the
mo&#383;t ea&#383;y and graceful motion, amid&#383;t the acclamations
of thou&#383;ands of &#383;pectators, and a federal &#383;alute from

harbour, commanded by Capt. Thomas Williams. The Committee
acting for the &#383;ub&#383;cribers, Col. Hacket, the

thus the &#383;atisfaction of producing to their country as fine
a &#383;hip, of her &#383;ize, as graces the American Navy. It is
not yet known who will command her; but it is on all hands
agreed that &#383;he is well calculated to do e&#383;&#383;ential
&#383;ervice to her country.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class='center'>
<i>And</i> ADAMS <i>&#383;aid</i>, "<span class="smcap">Let there be a Navy</span>!"<br />
<i>and there was a Navy.</i></p>

<p>To build a Navy was the advice of our venerable &#383;age. How
far it has been adhered to, is demon&#383;trated by almo&#383;t
every town in the United States, that is capable of floating a
<i>galley</i> or a <i>gun boat</i>.</p>

<p>Salem has not been backward in this laudable de&#383;ign.
Impre&#383;&#383;ed with a due &#383;en&#383;e of the importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> of a Navy,
the patriotic citizens of this town put out a
&#383;ub&#383;cription, and thereby obtained an equivalent for
building a ve&#383;&#383;el of force. Among the foremo&#383;t in this
<i>good work</i> were Me&#383;&#383;rs. <span class="smcap">Derby</span> and <span class="smcap">Gray</span>, who &#383;et the
example by &#383;ub&#383;cribing <span class="smcap">ten thousand dollars</span> each. But
alas! the former is no more&mdash;we tru&#383;t his <i>good deeds follow
him</i>.</p>

<p>Such was the patriotic zeal with which our citizens were
impre&#383;&#383;ed, that in the &#383;hort &#383;pace of SIX MONTHS they
contracted for the materials and equipment of a Frigate of 32
guns, and had her completed ye&#383;terday for launching. The
chief part of the timber was &#383;tanding but &#383;ix months
ago&mdash;and in a <i>moment</i>, as it were, "<i>every Grove
de&#383;cended</i>," to put in force the patriotic intentions of
tho&#383;e at who&#383;e expen&#383;e &#383;he was built.</p>

<p>Ye&#383;terday the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on board the
Frigate ESSEX, and at 12 o'clock &#383;he made a majestic
movement into her de&#383;tined element, there to join her
&#383;i&#383;ter craft in repelling foreign aggre&#383;&#383;ions, and
maintaining the <i>Rights</i> and <i>Liberties</i> of a "<span class="smcap">Great, Free,
Powerful &amp; Independent Nation</span>."</p>

<p>The concour&#383;e of &#383;pectators was immen&#383;e; and the averted
face of jacobini&#383;m was not &#383;een depicted on the
countenance of a &#383;ingle one;&mdash;but on the contrary, the
heart-felt &#383;atisfaction of the beholders of this magnificent
&#383;pectacle, was evinced by the concording &#383;houts and huzzas
of thou&#383;ands, which reiterated from every quarter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The unremitting zeal of Mr. <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>, the Architect of this
beautiful &#383;hip, cannot be too highly applauded. His
a&#383;&#383;iduity, in bringing her into a &#383;tate of &#383;uch
perfection, in &#383;o &#383;hort a time, entitles him to the
grateful thanks of his country; and we fondly hope that his
labours have not been &#383;pent in vain, for we may truly &#383;ay
that he has not <i>given re&#383;t to the &#383;ole of his foot</i>,
&#383;ince her keel was fir&#383;t laid.</p></div>

<p>A case of short weight of a load of hay is gravely advertised in the

<div class="blockquot"><p><small>Mr. RUSSELL,</small></p>

<p>THIS day came <span class="smcap">Ezekiel Kingsbury</span>, jun., of Dedham, with a Load
of Hay to be weighed, which was accordingly done. After it was
weighed, he drove it off round Mr. <i>Greenleaf's</i> corner, where
he &#383;topped. Mr. <i>Jonathan Tra&#383;k</i>, truckman, wanted to
purcha&#383;e a load of hay&mdash;went and tried to bargain with him
for it, and as he was going towards the hay, he perceived a
man rai&#383;e his head on the top of the load, by the name of
<i>Draper</i>, of &#383;aid town. He accordingly came to me and told
me of it. I went in pur&#383;uit of <i>King&#383;bury</i>, and overtook
him ju&#383;t before he got to the Granary, and ordered him back
to the &#383;cales to have his load weighed again, which weighed
one hundred and an half le&#383;s that it did before.&mdash;The

<p>It seems to have been the fashion in "old times" with people who had
articles stolen from them to advertise in the papers, requesting the thief
or thieves to make restitution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> Probably this was the surest method of
recovery, in the absence of the detective system. Joseph Tyler in the
"Boston Gazette," Nov. 21, 1761, is inclined to be sarcastic, and Samuel
Brazer, of Worcester, in 1802, is witty, but modest. As to stealing
psalm-books, no one would dream of doing such a thing in these days. Our
modern thieves are not interested in devotional books; they prefer
"yellow-covered literature."</p>

introduced into Salem, everybody burned wood, so that wood-sawing was an
occupation of considerable importance. During the war of 1813<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> wood became

among other accomplishments speak high &amp; low Dutch. At this time two
dollars and a half was the value of a pound in New York currency, while
the New England currency was three dollars and thirty-three cents to a
pound. To this day a shilling is 12-1/2 cents in New York, and in New
England 16-2/3 cents.</p>

attaches to the following advertisement from the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> the exhibition

<p><i>Abraham was old and well stricken in age: And the Lord had
blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his
eldest Servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had,
Thou shalt go unto my Country, and to my Kindred, and take a
Wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> unto my Son Isaac. And the Servant took ten Camels, of
the Camels of his Master, and departed; and went to
Mesopotamia, unto the city Nahor. And he made his Camels to
kneel down without the city, by a well of water, at the time
of the evening, even the time that Women go out to draw water.
Pure wisdom directed the Servant, and succeeded him in
obtaining the consent of the Parents, Brethren and Kindred of
Rebeccah, that she should go to the Land of Canaan, and become
the Wife of Isaac. And they sent away Rebeccah, their Sister,
with her Damsels and her Nurse, &amp; Abraham's Servant, &amp; his

<p>In 1796 a mermaid was exhibited in Salem, and in 1800 a cassowary bird.
The admission fee to the latter curiosity was for "grown persons" 12-1/2
cents, and for children 6-1/4 cents. The exact change could then be easily
made, as the Spanish silver ninepences (12-1/2 cents) and fourpence
halfpence (6-1/4 cents) were more common than any other silver pieces. The

seen nearer than the islands of Banda, Sumatra, Java, the
Molucca islands, and the corresponding parts of the continent.
Yet even here this animal seems not to have multiplied in any
considerable degree, as we find one of the kings of Java

<p>The following notice, taken from the "Salem Gazette," July 13, 1790, has
an interest to us from what it says of the likenesses "produced from a
Spark of Electricity." It is difficult to conjecture what this means;
though additional interest is derived from the fact of these likenesses
having been presented by Dr. Franklin's grandson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Peale</span>, of Philadelphia, has lately received a number of

<p>The Finger of Mr. Broliman (a provincial officer in the

executed at Philadelphia for the murder of a Mr. Scull. This
unfortunate gentleman, &#383;oured by &#383;ome di&#383;gu&#383;t, became
weary of life. In this temper of mind, he one morning ro&#383;e
earlier than u&#383;ual, and walked out upon the common of the
city, with his fu&#383;ee in hand, determined to &#383;hoot the
fir&#383;t per&#383;on he &#383;hould meet. The fir&#383;t per&#383;on he
&#383;aw was a very pretty young girl, who&#383;e beauty di&#383;armed
him. The next pre&#383;ented was the late Dr. Cadwallader&mdash;The
Doctor, bowing politely to Mr. Broliman (who, though unknown
to him, had the garb and appearance of a gentleman) acco&#383;ted
him with "Good morning, Sir! What &#383;port?" The Officer
an&#383;wered the Doctor very civilly; and was &#383;o &#383;truck with
his gentlemanly manner and plea&#383;ing addre&#383;s, that he
forebore to execute his de&#383;perate re&#383;olution: Impelled,
however, by the &#383;ame gloomine&#383;s of di&#383;po&#383;ition which
actuated him when he fir&#383;t &#383;et out, he repaired to the

in&#383;tantly &#383;hot Mr. Scull, one of the company, who died of
the wound.</p>

<p>This little &#383;tory affords a &#383;triking proof, that

plea&#383;ing, but u&#383;eful, in our commerce with the world.</p></div>

<p>Salem always was famous for its collections of natural and historical
curiosities, and many of its houses are now well stocked with such things.
Among these collections we may mention Mr. Geo. R. Curwen's antique family
portraits, china, clothing, and furniture; Mr. M.A. Stickney's rare coins,
old paper money, and books, autographs, etc.; Mr. H.F. Waters's rare
ancient furniture (Mr. Waters is now in London, engaged in historical
research in reference to American families); Mr. John Robinson's
remarkable collection of Chinese coins, and scarce views of old houses of
Salem; Mr. T.F. Hunt's valuable collection of Chinese books and pictures;
Rev. Dr. Bolles's fine collection of works on London; Rev. B.F. McDaniel's
collection of engravings, etc.; Mr. N.J. Holden's and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> Mr. F.P.
Richardson's collections of illustrated books, autographs, etc.; besides
numerous minor collections. It is not too much to say that Professor E.S.
Morse's collection of Japanese pottery is certainly not surpassed in the
world; the South Kensington collection in London, which is the best in
Europe, does not approach it in size or importance. One of the best
museums of our country was started in Salem in the latter part of the last
century, and that collection is now, as is well known, in charge of the
Peabody Academy of Science. Its objects of natural history have in recent
years been carefully classified and arranged under the direction of Dr.
Henry Wheatland, Professors Morse, Putnam, Packard, and Robinson; and its
cabinets, together with those of the Essex Institute, now contain probably
more unique and valuable specimens than are to be found elsewhere in this
country.</p>

<p>The "silhouette," or cheap portrait cut in black paper, was much in vogue
in New England some seventy or eighty years ago. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> process was named
from M. Silhouette, an honest French minister who about 1759 was noted for
his advocacy of economy in everything relating to the public welfare. He
received a great deal of ridicule, and hence all inexpensive things were
said to be <i>&agrave; la Silhouette</i>. At the rooms of the Essex Institute, and in
many houses in Salem, there are numerous silhouettes of former citizens of
the place. Those who remember the originals consider the likenesses often
very striking.</p>

<p>In September, 1808, we have a notice of a circus, in which the
horsemanship, according to the representations, must have equalled that of
Barnum's people. It is not common to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> much editorial comment in the
papers of the time on such exhibitions, from which we judge that they were
not considered first-class entertainments, and were not as much patronized

<p>Just before the declaration of the last war against Great Britain
"Non-Intercourse Quills" were for sale. This reminds us that most young
people know but little about quills of any kind, and probably not one in a
hundred knows, in these days, how to make a quill pen. Quills were in
pretty general use for writing until about 1835 or 1836, when steel pens
took their place to some extent, although quill pens were used by many
down to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> comparatively recent period, and occasionally a person may now
be seen using one. Steel and silver pens were made by Shakers as early as
1824, and Cushing &amp; Appleton had steel pens as early as 1811, according to
an advertisement in the "Salem Gazette."</p>

<p>Many young people do not know that in old times blotting-paper of the kind
now in use had not been introduced. Black sand was used altogether for
drying the ink on freshly written letters or ordinary writing, except in
books, when the writers either waited for the ink to dry, or made China
paper, taken from the inside of tea-chests, a blotter. Black sand was in
general use until within thirty years or thereabouts. We have seen the
sand adhering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> to writing which had been done more than a century. No

<p>In February, 1829, Mr. Nazro, of the Roundhill School (Northampton?), made
the following singular challenge to Edwin Forrest, the tragedian. We do
not know whether or not it was accepted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Boston Evening Bulletin of Wednesday last contains the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">A Card</span>. If Mr. Edwin Forrest, the Tragedian, thinks that more
effect can be produced by reading Tragedy than can be by
reading from Scripture, Mr. Nazro, Instructor of Elocution,

him, Mr. Forrest, in any town in the United States, and read
from Scripture, and Mr. Forrest shall read from Tragedy.</p>
